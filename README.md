# AI-Powered Customer Club - Full Stack Application

An AI-driven customer engagement platform built with a modern tech stack, featuring a React TypeScript frontend and Django REST API backend. 

The backend calls OpenAI for chat and recommendations.

This monorepo uses Git submodules to manage both applications independently while maintaining a cohesive development workflow.

First clone and setup the backend and then the frontend and see the login/register on [https://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
